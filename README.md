## 🎨 UI Refresh (v0.2)

We've completely overhauled the user interface with Fortune-500 quality design while maintaining the app's simplicity and local-first principles:

### What's New
- **Design System**: Implemented comprehensive design tokens for consistent spacing, colors, and typography
- **Component Library**: Built reusable UI components (Button, Card, Input, Badge, Toast) for maintainability
- **Mobile-First Navigation**: Responsive hamburger menu for small screens with sticky header and backdrop blur
- **Enhanced Empty States**: Friendly, actionable messages with clear CTAs instead of generic text
- **Toast Notifications**: Real-time feedback when completing habits or performing actions
- **Improved Visual Hierarchy**: Better spacing, modern card designs with subtle shadows and borders
- **Accessibility**: Added ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and proper focus states
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Gradient progress bars, hover animations, and smooth transitions

### Key Improvements
1. **Today Page**: Elevated cards with better spacing, larger checkboxes, enhanced progress visualization
2. **Navigation**: Sticky header with logo, tagline, and responsive mobile menu
3. **Empty States**: Engaging illustrations and actionable CTAs instead of plain text
4. **Form Inputs**: Consistent styling with validation feedback and helper text
5. **Dark Mode**: Comprehensive dark mode support maintained across all new components

All improvements maintain zero external dependencies (pure Tailwind CSS) and pass production builds.

## 🔒 Privacy

**100% Local-First.** All your data is stored in your browser's local storage. Nothing is sent to any server. Your habits and progress are completely private and under your control.
